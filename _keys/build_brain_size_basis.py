"""build_brain_size_basis.py -- author _keys/brain_size_basis.csv.

One row per (paper, whole-brain-size column) that exists anywhere in the repo,
recording WHAT PHYSICAL QUANTITY the column is and WHAT IS INCLUDED in it, so
that "which of these may be pooled or plotted against each other" is a lookup
rather than a judgement call. Cranial capacity is not brain weight; a brain
volume may or may not include the meninges; a mass converted from a volume at
1 cm3 = 1 g is not a weighed mass.

THE RULE OBSERVED HERE: an inclusion is recorded as yes/no ONLY where the
source's own definitions file says so. Everything else is `unknown`. Nothing is
inferred from what is conventional in the field, because the whole point of the
key is to separate what the sources state from what a reader assumes.

Fields
  paper, column, unit_as_printed   the harvested identity
  quantity        mass | volume | endocranial_volume | sum_of_structure_volumes
                  | residual | log_mass
  basis           the finer measurement basis (see BASIS_NOTES below)

  includes_olfactory_bulb / includes_meninges / includes_ventricles_csf
                  yes | no | unknown   (quoted evidence only)
  poolable_group  columns sharing a group may be pooled; across groups they may
                  not, and the app warns
  is_size         FALSE for residuals and logged copies - not a size at all
