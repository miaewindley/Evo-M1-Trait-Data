# How to make a snapshot — a guide for RAs

This dataset compiles published trait tables from many papers into one
comparable format. For every table we keep four files in the paper's folder:

| file | what it is |
|---|---|
| `..._snapshot.csv` *(or `.xlsx`, or a born-digital file's original extension)* | **the snapshot** — a frozen, faithful copy of the table *as published* |
| `....csv` | the cleaned, analysis-ready data ("use this") |
| `....R` | the script that turns the snapshot into the clean CSV |
| `....ReadMe.md` | a short note on where the table came from and what was done |

This guide is about the first one.

## What a snapshot is

> **A snapshot is a frozen, faithful digital copy of a published table, saved
> exactly as it appears in the source — before any cleaning.**

Think of it as a photograph of the table. It looks like the paper: same layout,
same column headers, same values, same footnote marks, same reference numbers,
same units. It is *digitized* (so R can read it — CSV or Excel) but **not yet
tidied**.

## Why we bother (the point of it)

The snapshot is the **audit anchor** between the paper and our analysis.

- **Traceability.** Anyone can lay the snapshot next to the PDF and confirm,
  cell by cell, that we copied the paper correctly.
- **Separation of "what the paper said" from "what we changed."** Every edit —
  renaming a column, dropping a unit, fixing a typo — happens *after* the
  snapshot, inside the `.R` script. So the changes are visible and reversible.
- **Durability.** Papers, links and supplementary files disappear. The snapshot
  is our own permanent copy. *(We keep a hardcopy snapshot file even when the
  data is also available at a URL.)*

If the clean data ever looks wrong, the snapshot is how we find out whether the
mistake came from the paper or from our cleaning.

## The one golden rule

**Freeze the snapshot before you clean anything. Do all cleaning in the `.R`
script.**

The most common mistake is saving the snapshot *after* already renaming headers
or stripping symbols — then it no longer matches the paper, and the whole point
(comparison to source) is lost. Capture first, clean second.

**The other way to fake a snapshot: hardcoding.** A `data.frame` typed into the
build script — with cleaned column names, split mean/SEM columns, markers
already converted to flags — written out as `..._snapshot.csv` on every run is
**not a snapshot**; it is the product wearing the snapshot's name, and it leaves
nothing to audit the cleaning against. The tell: the "snapshot" and the clean
CSV are the same file. A hand transcription is fine (that's method 5 below),
but it must be typed **as printed, into the frozen file**, and the `.R` must
**read** that file — never regenerate it. An `*_extract.R` that *builds* a
snapshot from the PDF/HTML source is different and fine: it saves the captured
hardcopy first, then cleaning starts from that file.

## Choosing the format (evidence, not product)

**The snapshot is evidence, not product.** Choose the capture that minimizes
transformation between the publication and the file on disk; all
standardization happens later, in the scripted build. Fidelity is measured
against the published page — never against an extraction tool's output.

A format conversion is an edit, and the snapshot exists to precede all edits.
Converting an Excel capture to a "standard" CSV flattens merged headers,
coerces types, and drops footnote marks and formatting that carry meaning —
the file stops being evidence and becomes a derived product pretending to be
one. So there is no standard snapshot *format*, only a standard *rule*, by
source type:

1. **Born digital** — the journal or repository supplies the data as
   `.csv` / `.xlsx` / `.tsv`: the untouched download **is** the snapshot.
   Copy-rename it to `<Paper>_<locus>_snapshot.<original ext>`, bytes
   untouched — never open-and-resave, never convert. Record the original
   filename, URL and download date in the ReadMe.
2. **Printed table** (PDF or scan) — transcribe it:
   - flat layout → **`_snapshot.csv`** (the default: plain text, diffable);
   - layout that CSV cannot hold losslessly (multi-row or merged headers,
     superscript footnote marks, formatting that carries meaning) →
     **`_snapshot.xlsx`**. Excel here is not a compromise; it is the more
     faithful medium.
3. **No published table** — the values live in a figure or in prose: build a
   *constructed snapshot* (see *When there is no table*, below).

Never add a conversion step to make snapshots uniform: it duplicates the
file — and worse, it leaves two frozen copies, and two frozen sources is one
too many.

## What the snapshot must keep (fidelity checklist)

Keep everything that is in the printed table, even if it looks messy:

- [ ] **Original column headers** (even long, multi-line, or symbol-heavy ones)
- [ ] **All values exactly as printed** — including units, `×10⁶`-style notation,
      and spaces inside numbers (`47 960`)
- [ ] **Footnote markers** — `*`, superscript letters (`218a`), daggers, etc.
- [ ] **Reference citations** printed in the cells — `[19]`, `(20)`
- [ ] **`n.a.` / `—` / blank** cells, as printed (don't "fix" them yet)
- [ ] **Grouping / header rows** (e.g. clade names that span the table)
- [ ] **Row order** as published

Cleaning (numbers → numeric, splitting columns, NCBI species names, etc.) comes
later, in the script. Not here.

## How to make one — methods, best first

1. **Direct download.** If the journal offers the table/supplement as `.xlsx`
   or `.csv`, download it and use that file as the snapshot. Easiest and most
   faithful. Copy-rename it to `..._snapshot.<original ext>` with the bytes
   untouched — never open-and-resave or convert (see *Choosing the format*).

2. **Web-scrape the publisher's HTML.** Pull the table from the open-access
   HTML version (PMC, journal site) in R with `rvest` — handy when the PDF won't
   extract (e.g. a wide, rotated table). **The scraping script must also save
   the snapshot**: write it to `..._snapshot.csv` *before* any cleaning, so the
   scrape is captured as a hardcopy on every run (don't rely on the live URL
   alone). Cross-check against the PDF and note the HTML source in the ReadMe.
   *(Worked example in the repo: `HerculanoHouzel__2015/` Table 1.)*

3. **Extract from a PDF of the paper.** If the table is published in a PDF, write
   a script to use a tool like tabulapdf (R) to extract it programmatically. This 
   works best for text-based PDFs; scanned documents may require OCR (e.g., 
   tesseract). Plain `pdftools::pdf_text` + regex also works well for small
   tables and for values printed in running text — worked example:
   `Jacob_etal_2021/Jacob_etal_2021_extract_snapshot.R` (no values typed in the
   script; anchored printed literals for headers/notes; two-column reading-order
   reconstruction; refuses to overwrite a differing frozen copy). Prefer this
   over manual entry whenever the PDF has a usable text layer.

4. **PDF → Excel (our default for printed tables).** Open the PDF in Adobe
   Acrobat Pro → *Export a PDF → Microsoft Excel Workbook*. Copy/paste the table
   and lightly reformat so it matches the printed layout. Save as
   `..._snapshot.xlsx`.

5. **Manual entry** (when the PDF is a scan or export is garbled). Type it in,
   keeping the original layout. Then double-check it — e.g. ask an AI assistant
   to read the table from the PDF and diff it against your file, and correct any
   mismatches by hand. Record in the ReadMe **who typed it and when** — this
   applies to an AI assistant exactly as to a person: "transcribed by <RA / AI
   assistant> on <date>, verified against the PDF by <how>". A reading step
   that leaves no record is how "hardcoded" numbers happen; the values always
   come from somewhere, and the ReadMe must say where and through whom.

Whatever the method, the result is the same kind of file: a faithful, frozen
copy you can compare to the paper.

## When there is no table (constructed snapshots)

Sometimes the values are published only in a figure or in running text. The
snapshot is then a table **we** construct — name it by its locus:
`<Paper>_Figure2_snapshot.csv`, `<Paper>_text_snapshot.csv`. Because the
tabular form itself is our work, the extraction method is part of the
provenance and the ReadMe **must** record it:

- **from a figure** — the tool (e.g. WebPlotDigitizer), the calibration
  points, and the axis assumptions;
- **from text** — which section and sentences the values come from, quoted or
  cited precisely.

The fidelity checklist still applies to the values themselves (units,
footnote marks, `n.a.` as printed). Everything downstream is unchanged.

## File naming

Inside the paper's folder (e.g. `JardimMesseder_etal_2017/`):

```
<Paper>_<Table>_snapshot.csv     # or .xlsx — the snapshot
<Paper>_<Table>.csv              # cleaned data, "use this"
<Paper>_<Table>.R                # snapshot -> clean
<Paper>_<Table>.ReadMe.md        # source + steps
```

`<Table>` is the **locus**: `Table1`, `TableS2`, `Figure2`, `text`, or the
original dataset name for a born-digital download.

The ReadMe follows the team pipeline:
`Source → Snapshot → Data readable → (Transpose / Variables / Species notes) →
Online database`. The full, authoritative sequence — and what happens to the
snapshot after this guide — is in **`__HOWTO_build_a_dataset_file.md`** (the old
`Pipeline` sheet in `__ReadMe.xlsx` has been retired in favour of that file).
Copy the format of any existing `*.README.md`.

## Quick self-check before you move on

- Could someone open my snapshot next to the PDF and see they're the same table?
- Did I keep the footnotes and reference numbers?
- Is *every* change to the data written down in the `.R` script (and nothing
  baked silently into the snapshot)?
- Did I save a local snapshot file, even though the data is online?
- Does the `.R` **read** the snapshot (rather than write it from hardcoded
  values), and does the snapshot actually differ from the clean CSV?

If yes to all four, the snapshot is proper.
