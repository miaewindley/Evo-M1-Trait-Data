# Specimen / concept note: Pongo (orangutan) — the pygmaeus / abelii split

## Purpose

This note tracks the taxonomic-history problem in the orangutan (*Pongo*) data
and explains why it needs **two different mechanisms**, not one. It is the
reference worked example for the two-layer specimen / taxon-concept model in
`_keys/specimen_crosswalk/` (see `SCHEMA.md`).

## The core problem

*Pongo* used to be **one species** and is now **two**. Before Groves (2001),
*Pongo pygmaeus* was used *sensu lato* for all orangutans. Groves elevated the
Sumatran form to full species rank as *Pongo abelii*, leaving *Pongo pygmaeus*
(*sensu stricto*) for the Bornean form.

Two consequences, which behave differently in the database:

1. **A single specimen** recorded long ago as "*Pongo pygmaeus*" may in fact be
   a Sumatran animal — i.e. modern *P. abelii*. That is resolvable at the
   specimen level.
2. **An old species *mean*** labelled "*Pongo pygmaeus*" may be an average over
   a **mix** of Bornean, Sumatran, and possibly captive **hybrid** individuals.
   That is **not** resolvable — you cannot un-average a pooled mean into its
   modern species. It must stay attached to the old broad concept.

This is why Pongo cannot be handled the way the gibbon *Disco* was. Disco is one
individual with conflicting labels (resolve to one identity). An old *Pongo
pygmaeus* mean is one label over many individuals (do not split).

## Evidence in this dataset

### 1. The master catalog hides Sumatran animals inside "Pongo pygmaeus"

`specimens info 151211.xls` (sheet `catalog`) lists 9 orangutans, **all** under
`species = Pongo pygmaeus`. Two of them carry a `subspecies` value that reveals
they are Sumatran:

| catalog id | collection | species | subspecies | sex |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| CAT-150 | Zilles | Pongo pygmaeus | `Pongo pygmaeus abeli` | M |
| CAT-151 | Zilles | Pongo pygmaeus | `sumatra` | F |

A species-mean pipeline that reads only the `species` column never sees the
`subspecies` field, so these Sumatran (modern *P. abelii*) individuals are
silently folded into a "*Pongo pygmaeus*" average.

### 2. MacLeod 2000 records the split label on a specimen directly

MacLeod (2000) Appendix I ("Duesseldorf records of primates used in volumetric
study, Hirnforschung sample") lists four *Pongo* specimens. One carries **both**
species names in its printed cell:

| MacLeod id | printed specimen cell | sex | brain g | fixed vol cc |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0475 | `PONGO (ZILLES)+A79` | F | NA | 107.6 |
| **YN85-38** | **`PONGO PYGMAEUS / ABELII / ZILLES (SEMEND.)`** | M | 369 | 216.3 |
| OY 1148 | `PONGO PYGMAEUS / ZILLES(SEMEND.) / HARRY (2/97)` | M | 440 | 186.11 |
| OHDZ / 6728 | `PONGO PYGMAEUS / ZILLES(SEMEND.) / BRIGGS (5/97)` | M | 345 | 154.89 |

**YN85-38** is the explicit pygmaeus→abelii case: the specimen was recorded as
*Pongo pygmaeus* and then annotated *abelii*, i.e. reassigned to the Sumatran
species under newer taxonomy. It is resolved to *Pongo abelii* in the crosswalk.

### 3. The Duesseldorf collection overlap (why Stephan and Zilles values mix)

The *Pongo* specimens are Zilles/Semendeferi material sourced largely from
Yerkes, housed at the Düsseldorf C. & O. Vogt Institut für Hirnforschung — the
same institute as the Stephan collection. Because the two collections overlap
physically and were used together in later studies (MacLeod, de Sousa,
Bauernfeind, Barger), an orangutan value can enter a **Stephan-dataset**
comparison table having actually originated in the **Zilles/Rehkämper** stream.
The house names tie the two records systems together:

```text
catalog 'Harry'  (CAT-148, Zilles, Yerkes)  = MacLeod HARRY (2/97) / OY 1148
catalog 'Briggs' (CAT-147, Zilles, Yerkes)  = MacLeod BRIGGS (5/97) / OHDZ / 6728
```

## Recommended database treatment

### Specimen level (`specimen_crosswalk.csv`)

Track each physical animal as one `canonical_specimen`, keep every printed label
as an alias row, and set `resolved_taxon` only where the evidence supports it:

- `PONGO-YN85-38` → `resolved_taxon = Pongo abelii`, `taxon_conflict = TRUE`.
- `CAT-150`, `CAT-151` → `resolved_taxon = Pongo abelii` (subspecies field).
- HARRY, BRIGGS, 0475, and the remaining catalog rows → `resolved_taxon = NA`
  (no evidence to place them Bornean vs Sumatran); they stay linked to the
  broad concept until an accession record resolves them.

### Concept level (`taxon_concept_registry.csv`)

Any **pooled mean** printed as "*Pongo pygmaeus*" from a pre-2001 source maps to
the concept `Pongo pygmaeus (s.l.)` with `decomposable = FALSE`. Its
`believed_composition` states the sample may contain Bornean + Sumatran (+
hybrid) animals. It is **never auto-rewritten** to *P. pygmaeus s.s.* or
*P. abelii*.

## The hard rule (for the merge / comparison)

```text
specimen measurement  -> may be reassigned to a modern species via resolved_taxon
                         (surfaces taxon_conflict; never silent)
pooled s.l. mean      -> pinned to Pongo pygmaeus (s.l.); never split into a
                         modern species (would fabricate composition)
```

This is distinct from the DeCasien cross-genus **duplicate** case (Disco): a
duplicate is *one* specimen entered twice under two genera (dedup); an s.l.
pooled mean is *many* specimens under one label (do not split).

## What remains unresolved

- Which of the unmarked catalog orangutans (CAT-149, 152, 153, 174, 180) and
  MacLeod 0475 / HARRY / BRIGGS are Bornean vs Sumatran. Needs Yerkes / Zilles
  accession or pedigree records.
- Whether catalog CAT-150 (M, `abeli`, Yerkes) **is** MacLeod YN85-38 (M,
  `ABELII`, Yerkes). Sex, species annotation, and source agree; the identifier
  systems differ. Marked as a candidate match, unconfirmed.
- Whether any published "*Pongo pygmaeus*" mean in the corpus was computed over
  a Bornean+Sumatran mix (see `pongo_provenance_audit.csv`).
