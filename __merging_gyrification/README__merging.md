# Merging gyrification data

Compiles a comparative dataset of the **whole-cortex gyrification index (GI)** across papers,
following the same `standardized_term` + compile pattern as `__merging_volumes`,
`__merging_cellcounts`, and `__merging_cortical_areas`.

## Scope: GI only

`GI` = the **Zilles-method gyrification index**: the ratio of the total (inner + buried) cortical
contour to the superficially exposed (outer) contour, measured on coronal sections. GI = 1 means no
folding; higher = more folded. This merge pools **only** measures computed on that definition.

**Deliberately excluded:** the Mota & Herculano-Houzel **folding index (FI)** (`Mota_etal_2015`,
`Mota_etal_2019`). FI is a different construct (surface-area/thickness scaling), not interchangeable
with GI, and is never pooled with it. Those tables are built to house convention in their own
folders but do not feed this merge. Their exposed-surface-area columns belong with cortical-surface
data (`__merging_cortical_areas`), not here.

## Traits merged (standardized terms)

| Standardized_Term | meaning | unit |
|---|---|---|
| `Species` | accepted binomial (join key) | — |
| `GI` | whole-cortex gyrification index (Zilles method) | ratio (dimensionless) |

## Sources (this build)

| Reference | team | GI species | role |
|---|---|---|---|
| `Lewitus_etal_2014_TableS1` | Lewitus_2014 | 102 | **primary** (main compilation) |
| `Lewitus_etal_2014_TableS8` | Lewitus_2014 | 25 (11 new vs S1) | primary (fills species absent from S1) |
| `Zilles_etal_2013_Table1` | Zilles_2013 | 45 (non-primate) | primary for the 15 species Lewitus lacks; dependent elsewhere |

## Team-aware, citation-dependency-aware combine

Same rules as the blood-flow / volume merges:

- **Within a team (same paper), newest/authoritative wins.** Lewitus S1 and S8 are the same paper;
  S1 is authoritative and S8 only adds the 11 species missing from S1. Their GI values are
  **identical for all 14 shared species** (checked), so no conflict arises.
- **Across teams, average — UNLESS the sources are citation-dependent.** Zilles-2013 Table 1 is
  compiled partly *from* Lewitus 2014 (its source reference [7]) and uses the same Zilles GI method,
  so Lewitus-2014 and Zilles-2013 are **citation-dependent**. They are therefore **never averaged**.
  Rule applied: **prefer Lewitus** (the primary compilation); use **Zilles only for species Lewitus
  does not cover**. Every overlap keeps *both* raw values and is flagged.

### What that yields

128 species: **113** taken from Lewitus 2014, **15** Zilles-only (species Lewitus lacks), and
**30** citation-dependent overlaps where Lewitus is used but the Zilles value is retained alongside
for inspection. Lewitus and Zilles agree closely on the overlaps — only three differ by more than
0.3 GI units: *Capra hircus domestica* (2.28 vs 1.81), *Equus caballus* (2.80 vs 2.40),
*Globicephala macrorhynchus* (5.24 vs 5.55).

## Species aliases

To make the same animal join across sources, unambiguous same-species spelling variants are unified
(and Lewitus's printed typo `Odocoileus virginiatus` is corrected):

`Felis domestica`→`Felis catus`, `Sus scrofa domestica`→`Sus scrofa domesticus`,
`Equus burchelii`→`Equus burchelli`, `Capra aegagrus hircus`→`Capra hircus domestica`,
`Lama glama`→`Lama glama domesticus`, `Odocoileus virginiatus`→`Odocoileus virginianus`.

Genuinely distinct congeners are **kept separate**: *Bos taurus* vs *B. taurus indicus*,
*Ursus arctos* vs *U. maritimus*, *Tursiops aduncus* vs *T. truncatus*, *Globicephala melas* vs
*G. macrorhynchus*, and genus-level *Phoca sp.* / *Marmosa sp.*

## Outputs

- **`gyrification_long.csv`** — one row per (Species, source) GI observation (181 rows). Columns:
  `Species, Standardized_Term, GI, source, team, ref, dependency_group`. Zilles species keep one row
  per printed reference value.
- **`gyrification_wide.csv`** — one row per species (128). Columns: `Species, GI` (the merged value),
  `source_used`, `GI_Lewitus2014`, `GI_Zilles2013_mean`, `GI_Zilles2013_n/min/max`, `n_teams`,
  `citation_dependency`, `GI_abs_diff` (|Lewitus − Zilles| on overlaps).
- **`gyrification_source_species_ids.csv`** — provenance: which source contributed each species value.
- **`standardized_term_gyrification.csv`** (+ `standardized_term.R`, `standardized_term_by_reference/`)
  — the original→standardized column map, stacked per source.

## Rebuild

Run `gyrification_compiled.R` (reads the sources' public TSVs from `__Public/comparative-data/`;
regenerate a source TSV first if its snapshot/CSV changed). `standardized_term.R` restacks the term
map if a per-reference term file changes.

## Notes / future
- Zilles 2013 Table 1 contains **no primates** (primate GI is in that paper's Figure 2). Primate GI
  in this merge therefore comes entirely from Lewitus 2014.
- To add a future GI source, drop a `<Reference>_standardized_terms.csv` in
  `standardized_term_by_reference/`, add the Item name to `item_name` in `gyrification_compiled.R`,
  set its `team`, and decide its dependency relationship to the existing sources.
