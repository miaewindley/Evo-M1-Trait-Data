# Energetics compiled merge (Part IV) -- mirror of __merging_volumes/volumes_compiled.R for
# brain metabolic rate. Builds a two-tier merge of the energetics papers from energetics_long.csv.
#
# Measures: CMRgl (glucose), CMRO2 (oxygen) in umol/100 g/min; CBF in mL/100 g/min.
# Sources in energetics_long.csv: Heiss_etal_2004 (Homo sapiens) and Kaufman_2004 (12 genera).
#   Karbowski 2007 is NOT in energetics_long.csv (source xlsx headers are OCR-garbled and were not
#   parsed); it stays excluded and is noted in the ReadMe, not merged here.
#
# Resolution (mirrors the volume merge): each independent series is its own Tier-2 team; values are
# averaged ACROSS teams per (Species, Region, Measure). Only Homo overlaps between Heiss and Kaufman.
# Kaufman means are the WEIGHTED means (the only ones present); any "unweighted" rows are dropped.
