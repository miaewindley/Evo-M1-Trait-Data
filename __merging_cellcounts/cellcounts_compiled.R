# 3.4c Laterality-basis fix for Jardim-Messeder et al. 2017 Table 1: Procyon lotor hippocampus mass.
#      The published raccoon hippocampus row is internally inconsistent by exactly a factor of two:
#      printed DNHP (16,076 /mg) is half of NHP / MHP (15.34e6 / 477 mg = 32,159 /mg). The printed
#      O/NHP (4.564) equals OHP / NHP (70.00e6 / 15.34e6), so NHP and OHP are tied to each other,
#      leaving two candidate readings -- a halved mass, or both counts doubled. A density is
#      basis-invariant (N/M is the same for one side as for both), so DNHP cannot be corrupted by a
#      side error, and every test points to MHP as the single printed error -- the mass of ONE
#      hippocampus printed against bilateral counts:
#        - Of the 42 checkable N.p.mg cells in this table, 41 agree with NHP/MHP to within 0.4%.
#          This row is the only 2x cell, so it is not a table-wide convention.
#        - Felis catus has almost the same brain mass (34.86 g vs 34.19 g). Its hippocampus is 2.51%
#          of brain (dog 2.32%); the printed raccoon value is 1.40%, and doubled it is 2.79%.
#        - OHP / MHP as printed is 146,751 /mg, the highest in the table by 1.65x; doubling the mass
#          gives 73,375 /mg, between cat (63,870) and ferret (89,088).
#        - Printed NHP is 0.71% of NBR, in line with ferret 0.79% and cat 0.66%. Halving the counts
#          instead would drop it to 0.36%, so the counts look right.
#        - DIRECT CONFIRMATION, same species and method: Jacob et al. 2021 (DOI 10.1002/cne.25197;
#          Herculano-Houzel a co-author of both) reports raccoon hippocampus mass AND hippocampal
#          nuclei counts by isotropic fractionation for ONE hemisphere: pooled mass 474.01 mg
#          (n=18), total nuclei 42.60e6 (n=18). The printed mass matches Jacob's unilateral mass to
#          0.6%; the printed total cell count is 2x Jacob's unilateral count to 0.3%; and on the
#          doubled mass the total-cell density agrees with Jacob to 0.5% (89,455 vs 89,874 /mg),
#          where on the printed mass it is off by exactly 2x. The neuronal/nonneuronal split does
#          NOT agree (18.0% vs 13.4% neurons) but Jacob's neuron count is a difference of means
#          over non-identical samples (n=18 vs 17), so it is not used as evidence. Check:
#          restricted_checks/_cross_table/JardimMesseder_2017_vs_Jacob_2021_raccoon/
#        - Congener cross-check: Reep et al. 2007 gives Procyon cancrivorus
#          Hippocampus_Vol.mm3 = 1,025.76 at a comparable brain size (36,858 mm3 summed, vs 34,100
#          for P. lotor), and __merging_volumes/laterality_known.csv records Reep values as already
#          bilateral. Across size-comparable congeneric pairs, this table's mass / Reep volume runs
#          0.72-1.14 (Canis 0.904, Panthera leo 0.788, P. leo vs pardus 1.135, Ursus 0.717). The
#          raccoon sits at 0.451; doubled it is 0.902. (The Mustela pair is excluded -- ferret
#          against the much smaller weasel is not size-matched.)
#      So MHP is doubled to the bilateral basis of the counts. DNHP -- and therefore the reported
#      Hippocampus_N.p.mg the merge carries -- is correct and untouched; what this fixes is
#      Hippocampus_Mass.g itself and everything 3.7 derives from it (Hippocampus_O.p.mg was
#      146,751 /mg on the halved mass and becomes 73,375 /mg). _C.n and _p.C.N are unaffected.
#      The frozen source snapshot is deliberately NOT edited: it is the record of what the paper
#      printed, and the printed value is confirmed verbatim from the PDF (Table 1, p. 6).
#      NOT confirmed by the authors -- inferred. Revise if the Jardim-Messeder team supplies the
#      underlying mass. Separately unresolved: this raccoon's CerebralCortex fails the same
#      density check by 3.4%, which this correction does not explain.

# 3.7 Derive the cellular densities and ratios WITHIN each source, from that source's own primaries.
#
#     Why this step exists. The ratio variables are not reported on a common footing across the
#     literature. Isotropic fractionation measures a density in each DISSECTED piece, so the
#     Herculano-Houzel-team tables print densities per structure (cerebral cortex, cerebellum,
#     rest of brain) and print whole-brain TOTALS -- but no whole-brain density, because the whole
#     brain is not a dissected piece. The consequence, before this step, was that
#     WholeBrain_N.p.mg had exactly ONE value in cellcounts_long (Avelino de Souza et al. 2025,
#     the only table that tabulates a whole-brain density row) while WholeBrain_N.n and
#     WholeBrain_Mass.g were present in seven sources. The ratio was not missing from the data;
#     it was simply never computed.
#
#     Formulae (see _keys/glossary.csv for the measure codes):
#       _N.p.mg = _N.n   / (_Mass.g * 1000)   neurons per mg of tissue
#       _O.p.mg = _O.n   / (_Mass.g * 1000)   non-neuronal ("other") cells per mg
#       _I.p.mg = _I.n   / (_Mass.g * 1000)   microglia per mg
#       _O.p.N  = _O.n   / _N.n               non-neuronal cells per neuron
#       _I.p.C  = _I.n   / _C.n               microglia per cell
#       _p.C.N  = 100 * _N.n / _C.n           percent of cells that are neurons
#       _I.n    = _I.p.C * _C.n               microglia NUMBER -- the inverse direction, because
#                                             the microglia source reports the ratio, not the count
#
#     FILL-ONLY. A value the source itself reports is never overwritten, and the fill is row-wise
#     so one blank species never suppresses a column. Rationale: for isotropic-fractionation data
#     the density is the measured quantity and the count is density x mass, so a printed density
#     carries the authors' precision while a back-calculation from a rounded printed count and
#     mass does not. Where a reported and a derivable value coexist they agree to a median
#     |difference| of 0.02-0.24%; the handful that do not (85 species-cells above 2%, worst
#     Procyon lotor Hippocampus_N.p.mg at 100%, i.e. a factor of two) are source-table
#     inconsistencies worth inspecting, not values to silently overwrite.
#
#     Deriving here, inside each source, keeps a species x structure ratio tied to ONE paper's own
#     specimens, and lets it compete in the section 8 within-team priority resolution exactly as a
#     reported value would. Cross-table derivation -- unavoidable for microglia, whose ratio and
#     whose cell counts come from different papers -- happens later, in 9.1, and only for cells
#     that are still empty after filtering.

# Combine two measures of the same structure into a third: (a <op> b) * scale, element-wise.
# op is "/" for every ratio and density, and "*" for the one inverse rule (_I.n = _I.p.C * _C.n).

#### 9.1 Calculate: within-team between-tables values using the filtered dataset
#
#     Fill any cellular ratio still empty after the 8.3 priority resolution, using primaries that
#     survived filtering for the SAME species and SAME structure within the SAME team -- even when
#     the two inputs came from different tables. 3.7 has already covered everything derivable
#     inside a single source, so this step only reaches cells that no one paper can supply on its
#     own. The Source string becomes the two contributing sources joined, so a cross-table value is
#     never mistaken for a single-source measurement.
#
#     This is the step that yields microglia numbers and densities. Dos Santos et al. 2020
#     (unpublished) reports only the microglia/cell RATIO (_I.p.C); the cell counts (_C.n) and
#     masses (_Mass.g) for those same species come from other Herculano-Houzel-team tables, so
#     _I.n = _I.p.C * _C.n and _I.p.mg = _I.n / (_Mass.g * 1000) are only reachable here. This is
#     also why "_I.p.mg" had no values at all: no live source reports it, and the excluded
#     Dos Santos published Table 1 was the only table that ever printed one.
#
#     FILL-ONLY, on the same terms as 3.7: nothing already present is replaced, and a denominator
#     of zero or a missing input yields no row rather than an Inf or a NaN.

# Fill missing Species x Structure ratios in a team's long dataframe from its own primaries.
# df_long has columns Species, Variable, Source, Value (Value character, as built in 8.1).
