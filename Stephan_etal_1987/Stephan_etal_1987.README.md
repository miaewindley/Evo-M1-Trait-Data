# Stephan, Frahm & Baron 1987 — amygdala & amygdaloid components (Insectivora → Primates)

Stephan H, Frahm HD, Baron G (1987). *Comparison of Brain Structure Volumes in Insectivora and
Primates. VII. Amygdaloid Components.* Journal für Hirnforschung 28(5):571–584. (Received Sept 4, 1986.)
Part **VII** of the Stephan/Frahm/Baron series; same brain collection and methods as Stephan et al.
1981, 1982, 1984; Frahm et al. 1982, 1984; Baron et al. 1983, 1987.

Full table titles (for `__ReadMe.xlsx`):

- **Table 1** — "Volumes and indices of the amygdala (AMY) and amygdaloid components (LAM, MCB, MAM,
  NTO) in Macroscelidea, Insectivora and Scandentia"
- **Table 2** — "Volumes and indices of the amygdala (AMY) and amygdaloid components (LAM, MAM, MCB,
  NTO) in Primates. (0 = not determinable with certainty)"
- *(Table 3 — group-mean indices/percentages/ratios — is a derived summary and is **not** snapshotted.)*

## Source → Snapshot
Source is a **scanned PDF with no text layer** (`stephan_etal_1987_VII_scan.PDF`). Values were
triangulated three ways and agree: (1) independent OCR of the table pages, (2) visual read of the
rendered primate page, (3) the pre-existing extraction in `comparison/Stephan_1987.csv`. Internal
check **AMY = LAM + MAM** holds for all rows except one (see below).

- `Stephan_etal_1987_Table1_snapshot.csv` — 44 non-primates (2 Macroscelidea, 39 Insectivora,
  3 Scandentia), species as printed, volumes in **mm³**, paper order preserved.
- `Stephan_etal_1987_Table2_snapshot.csv` — 45 primates (18 prosimians, 26 simians + man).

89 species total — matches the paper's Methods exactly. Indices columns (Stephan size-indices vs the
Insectivora reference line) are **omitted** as derived; they are recomputable from the volumes.

## Data readable
`Stephan_etal_1987_Table1.R` / `_Table2.R` → `Stephan_etal_1987_Table1.csv` / `_Table2.csv`
(**use these**). Species harmonized to `_keys/Stephan/species_key.csv` (all 89 matched via
`source_publication == "Stephan1987"`); `species_printed` retained for traceability.

## Amygdaloid anatomy (how the columns nest)
- **AMY** = whole amygdaloid complex. **AMY = LAM + MAM.**
- **LAM** = cortico-basolateral group ("lateral amygdala") = lateral + basal + cortical nuclei.
- **MCB** = magnocellular part of the basal nucleus — a **subset of LAM** (not added on top).
- **MAM** = centromedial group ("medial amygdala") = central + medial nuclei + anterior amygdaloid area.
- **NTO** = nucleus of the lateral olfactory tract — sits **within MAM**. In simians/man it is printed
  as **0 = "not determinable with certainty"** (≈ below resolution), *not* a true zero.

## Amygdala equivalency — the column that carries across datasets
`amygdala_total_mm3` (**AMY**) is the variable that is **compatible across the Stephan-lineage and
Barger datasets**:

| dataset | column | notes |
|---|---|---|
| Stephan et al. 1987 (this) | AMY | amygdaloid complex, mm³ |
| Stephan et al. 1981 | "Amygdala" | same collection/definition (part of the same series) |
| Zilles & Rehkämper 1988 | "amygdala" | hominoid chapter; same structure definition |
| Barger et al. 2007 | `AC_total` | amygdaloid complex, both hemispheres (cm³ → ×1000 = mm³) |

See `comparison/Stephan1987_AMY_vs_Barger2007_AC.csv` for the head-to-head test on the shared
hominoids. **Agreed merge rule for the future Study-3 amygdala variable: average Stephan 1987 and
Barger where they overlap** (Homo, *Pan troglodytes*, *Gorilla gorilla*, *Hylobates lar*).

## Provenance / caveats
- Single Stephan/Frahm/Baron collection; values are species means (typically 1 specimen), fresh-volume
  corrected, mm³. Whether AMY is unilateral or bilateral is a known open question for the Stephan
  series — flagged in the comparison file (it bears on the Barger reconciliation).
- The faithful 1987 hominoids are only **Hylobates lar, Pan troglodytes, Gorilla gorilla, Homo sapiens**.
  *Pongo*, *Pan paniscus*, *Hylobates muelleri* in `comparison/Stephan_1987.csv` come from **other
  sources** (that file is a merged master list, not faithful 1987).
- *Setifer setosus* is printed AMY 68.7 though LAM+MAM = 71.1 — a rounding/measurement artifact in the
  original; kept as printed.
