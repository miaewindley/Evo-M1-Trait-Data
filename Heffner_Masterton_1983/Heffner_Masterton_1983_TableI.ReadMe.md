# Heffner & Masterton 1983 — Table I (Animals and descriptive data)

Heffner RS, Masterton RB (1983). *The role of the corticospinal tract in the evolution of
human digital dexterity.* Brain Behav Evol 23(3–4):165–183. doi:10.1159/000121494

Full table title (see `__ReadMe.xlsx`): **"Table I. Animals and descriptive data on which all
correlations are based."** 21 species rows. This is the smaller successor sample to
Heffner & Masterton 1975 Table I (`compare to 1975`).

## Source → Snapshot
PDF is paywalled and Table I is laid out across pages with stacked value/[reference] cells.
Transcribed by hand (kept to the original layout) and cross-checked against an AI table
extraction of the PDF. The frozen transcription lives in
`Heffner_Masterton_1983_TableI_snapshot.xlsx` (sheet `TableI_snapshot`): row 1 = title,
row 2 = column names, then one row per animal, values and bracketed references exactly as
printed. `Heffner_Masterton_1983_Tables.xlsx` holds the same Table I plus Tables II–IV
(dexterity scale, correlations, partial correlations) for reference.
*Recommend a visual diff against the PDF before publication.*

## Data readable
`Heffner_Masterton_1983_TableI.R` → `Heffner_Masterton_1983_TableI.csv` (**use this**).
Each measurement cell is split into a numeric value and its bracketed `*_ref`; numbers parsed;
common names moved to `common_name`, binomial to `Species`. Columns defined in
`reference_tables/Heffner_Masterton_1983_TableI_definitions.csv`.

## Species note
`Species` holds the binomial with two obvious transcription typos corrected —
*Erinaceous* → *Erinaceus* and *Macaca ira* → *Macaca irus* — while the exact printed string is
kept in `Species_as_printed`. Taxonomy is **not** modernised (e.g. *Cercopithecus pygerythrus*,
*Hylobates syndactylus*, *Galago crassicaudatus*, *Pongo pygmaeus* left as printed; reconcile to
`_keys/Stephan/species_key.csv` downstream). Four rows are genus-only as printed
(*Paraechinus*, *Didelphis*, *Tarsius*, and *Erinaceus*). Note *Macaca irus* = *M. fascicularis*.

## Provenance
Secondary compilation: most anatomical values are drawn from the bracketed literature sources,
behavioural ranks (phyletic level, digital dexterity) are Heffner & Masterton's own scales.
Measure: behavioural (digital dexterity) + corticospinal tract morphometry.
