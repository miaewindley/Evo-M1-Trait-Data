# Merging behaviour data

A keyed comparative **behavioural** merge across several measure classes — **vocal repertoire size**,
**digital dexterity**, **quadrupedal walking gait**, **locomotor diversity**, **hand preference
(handedness)**, and **manipulation complexity**. It produces the same long-table schema as the other
keyed merges (`__merging_body_ecology`, `__merging_brain_mass`): **one row per (Species, Measure)**
with the resolved `Value` plus source provenance (`n_sources`, `Teams`, `roles`, `value_min/max`).
The Shiny app loads it via `std_merge()`, exactly like body mass and brain mass.

## One variable per measure, from possibly several sources — never duplicated

Per `__HOWTO_build_a_dataset_file.md` §10 different measure classes are never pooled into one value:
each `Measure` is its own row/variable. Where a measure has more than one source, the value is
**resolved once** and the contributing sources are recorded as keys — the variable is **not**
duplicated. Two measures are multi-source and citation-dependent:

- **VocalRepertoire** — Schniter & Peñaherrera-Aguirre 2026 (primary, updated repertoire) +
  ManyPrimates 2022 (secondary). Both descend from McComb & Semple 2005 → **never averaged**; the
  resolved value is Schniter's, and where both report a species `value_min/value_max` show the spread
  (e.g. *Pan paniscus* value 11, min 11, max 38; `Value_median` is informational only).
- **Dexterity** — Heffner & Masterton 1975 (primary) + Iwaniuk 1999 (secondary). Iwaniuk is a
  re-analysis of the *same* data — identical values on every shared species → prefer Heffner.

The other four measures are single-source: Wimberly 2021 (gait), Granatosky 2018 (locomotion),
Caspar 2022 (handedness), Heldstab 2016 (manipulation).

## Inputs

Composes the harmonised, `species_sci`-keyed trait tables in `____EvoM1_TraitTable/`
(`vocal_repertoire_schniter/manyprimates`, `gait`, `locomotion`, `handedness`, `manipulation`), plus
two dedicated dexterity inputs **`dexterity_heffner.xlsx`** / **`dexterity_iwaniuk.xlsx`** (written by
`EvoM1_read_dexterity_corticospinal*.R`). Dexterity has its own input tables because the
corticospinal-tract trait tables the app melts no longer carry the dexterity column — that would
duplicate this merge. The species key mirrors `build_data.R`: `species_sci` where present, else the
printed `Species`, cleaned.

## Outputs

- **`behaviour_long.csv`** — the keyed merge, app-facing. One row per (Species, Measure). Columns:
  `Species, measure_class, Measure, Units, Value, Value_median, n_sources, n_teams,
  n_teams_primary, primary_used, Teams, roles, value_min, value_max` (same schema as
  `body_ecology_long.csv`). 1,206 rows over 319 species; multi-source rows: Dexterity (24 species),
  VocalRepertoire (16).
- **`behaviour_observations_long.csv`** — the raw per-source rows behind the resolution
  (`Species, measure_class, Measure, Team, role, Value`).
- **`behaviour_wide.csv`** — one row per species, resolved value per measure (overview).

## How the app shows it

`build_data.R` copies `behaviour_long.csv` into `__ShinyApp/data/` and the app reads it with
`std_merge(GH$behaviour, …, "Behaviour")`. Each measure appears **once** as
`"<Measure> (<Units>)"` under dataset **Behaviour**, with `Source = "EvoM1 <measure> merge (N sources)"`
and `N_sources`. No behavioural variable is melted from the trait tables any more, so nothing is
duplicated between datasets.

## Coverage

319 species. Per measure: Duty_Factor/Gait/Phase 154, Foot_Posture 136, Locomotor_diversity_index
113, Arboreal_terrestrial 96, Intermembral_index 80, Dexterity 67, VocalRepertoire 65, Handedness
38, Manipulation/Tool_use/Extractive_foraging 37.

## Rebuild

Run `behaviour_compiled.R` (reads the harmonised trait tables + the two dexterity inputs; rebuild a
source trait table first if its snapshot/CSV changed), then re-run `__ShinyApp/build_data.R`.

## Not included / future
- **Brain-volume laterality/asymmetry** (a volume measure in `__merging_volumes`) and Eagleman's
  developmental *time-to-locomotion* (life-history, excluded from `__merging_sleep`) are different
  constructs, not behavioural traits.
- To add a future behavioural source, add a `grab(...)` call and a `META` row in
  `behaviour_compiled.R`; if it shares a measure with an existing source, set its priority/role.
