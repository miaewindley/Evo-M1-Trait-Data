# Barbeito-Andres et al. 2019 (developmental / experimental mouse dataset)
Barbeito-Andres J, et al. (2019). *Region-specific changes in Mus musculus brain size and cell
composition under chronic nutrient restriction.* Journal of Experimental Biology.

## Separate comparison set (NOT in the volume merge)
Single species (Mus musculus) under experimental nutrition groups. This is a developmental/
experimental dataset, kept as its own comparison set; it is **not** part of the phylogenetic
volume merge in `__merging_volumes/`.

## Source -> Snapshot
`data_figshare.xlsx` sheet **Hoja1** only (Hoja2 and Hoja3 are empty). Hoja1 stacks three
sub-tables, frozen here as three faithful snapshots:
- `..._volumes_snapshot.csv`     - Absolute volumes (mm3), per specimen, 13 regions incl Total.
- `..._cellnumber_snapshot.csv`  - Cell number, per animal, 5 region groups x {Total, Neurons, Non-neurons}.
- `..._celldensity_snapshot.csv` - Cell density, same layout.
Groups: **C** = control, **LP** = low protein, **LCP** = low calorie + protein (labels as published).

## Data readable
`BarbeitoAndres_etal_2019.R` -> `BarbeitoAndres_etal_2019_tidy.csv`: one tidy long table aligned to a
generic developmental schema `species, reference, group, specimen, region, cell_type, measure, value,
units`. `measure` in {absolute_volume (mm3), cell_number, cell_density}.

## Units & scaling - VERIFIED (internal consistency)
The figshare sheet states no units. Resolved by an internal-consistency check (`cell_density x
absolute_volume` vs `cell_number`, per group x region x cell_type, using group-mean regional volumes;
Rest = Total - the four named regions):
- The ratio `(cell_density x volume) / cell_number` is consistent **across cell types within each
  region** (e.g. Cerebellum/C: Neurons 1254, Non-neurons 1218, Total 1251) and centres on **~10^3**
  (median 868, mean 944, range 681-1540 across 45 cells). The region-level spread reflects a
  volume-subset / parcellation mismatch (the cell-count subset carries no specimen ids), not a unit
  ambiguity - the within-region cross-cell-type agreement confirms the data is internally consistent.
- Confirmed scaling (isotropic-fractionator convention; volume mm3 ~ mg tissue, rho ~ 1 mg/mm3):
  - **cell_density = published value x 10^3 cells/mg**
  - **cell_number  = published value x 10^6 cells**
  - absolute_volume = mm3 (Total ~ 365-380 mm3 for a mouse brain -> consistent).
- Applied to `..._tidy.csv` (`units` column is now `10^3 cells/mg` / `10^6 cells`) and to
  `..._definitions.csv`. (No source PDF text was needed; verification is by internal arithmetic.)

## Remaining caveat
- The cell tables label rows by group only (no specimen id; `specimen = NA`), so per-animal pairing to
  the volume table is not possible from the snapshot; group-level means were used for the check above.

Pipeline: Source -> Snapshot OK -> Data readable OK -> units/scaling VERIFIED (internal consistency) -> standalone comparison set.
